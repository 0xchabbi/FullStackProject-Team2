_Full Stack Final Project_ : Meal Planner 
=======
_Full Stack Web development course at Code Factory Vienna_
[ _September 2021_ ]  

Overview
----

It's always hard to know what's the right food to eat and when. Planning
and organizing a meal in advance sometimes becomes a nightmare.
**This Web Application helps users organizing and planning meals over a short period of time.**


**To use this application the user must register and login first!**


* Each user can **add**, **edit** and **delete** their own **dishes**, and see other users' dishes.
* Each user can **plan a meal** by choosing one or more dishes for a specific **date and time**.
* Each user can view their **daily meal plan**.
* Before a dish becomes visible for all users it must be approved by an **admin** (the user/creator can see their entered dishes even before the approval ).
* Each admin can **block a user** from entering/using the plattform.

**IMPORTANT: in this project we differenciate between 'meals' and 'dishes'**   


**Dish:** is a specific recipe ( e.g. Spaghetti Bolognese ) the user can add, edit and delete  ( each user can see all other users' dishes but cannot edit them).


**Meal:** is a dish/set of dishes the user chose to plan for a specific date and time 
( e. g. On Wednesday the 29th September 2021 at 18:00 the user planned to cook 'Spaghetti Bolognese' and 'Green Salad' ).

Workflow
----

This Project was realised over a period of 10 days.


In order to keep and mantain a good workflow, that would allow a good work-life balance, the team had a SPRINT on the very first day of Project
and updated and mantained a constantly updated schedule through DAILY STAND-UPs, and SLACK group/inner communications.


Over the last three days of project all scheduled features were finalised and the Project was concluded on time for the final presentation.


After a skill assessment and individual wishes the team was split into two sub-groups : 'Frontend' and 'Backend'. 
This division however doesn't imply any lack of knowledge, but rather a higher skill set and predisposition for the chosen field.  
Only one team member didn't have previous Frontend knowledge and was therefore assigned to backend only duties.


Technologies used 
---
* HTML5
* CSS
* Boostrap
* mySQL
* PHP
* Symfony


The decision to use these technologies was done after assessing each team member's skillset. 

Using **Symfony** meant for us to take on a challenge, and use this Project not only to prove our already established knowledge but to **further develop our skills**.
Working with PHP alone is very straight forward, working with a framework instead requires a high confidence in cruising through the code, 
and using the vast features it provides, as well as understanding and finding the limitations that inevitably come along in a framework.


* Working within one's comfort zone gives safety and produces known results.
* Working right outside of it, is what fosters **progress** and **growth**.
* Knowing our skills, our limits and boundaries is to be professional and know our worth.





The Team
---

I  [ **Claudia** ], as team leader and coordinator of the project, I aided the whole team in:

* Mantaining clear and good communication
* Constantly reassessing priorities
* Maintaining a larger picture over the Project as well as the tasks at hand
* Documenting the process
* Coordinating the SPRINT
* Moderating the team meetings
* Making sure that each decision would be made by the whole team in stand-ups
* Aiding in maintaining the workflow for each sub-team/team-member
* Keeping a positive athmosphere within the team
* Allowing for time off and avoiding over-working
* Pushing further towards new but manageable Challenges (in accordance with the Project's guidelines)
* Creating a Project that would take each of us out of our comfort zone to foster growth (but not too far to lose motivation or damage the Project's outcome)
* Backend development

**Bilal**, **Felix**, **Patrik** and **Uros** were all great co-workers and each of them made sure 
to contribute to the development of this project at the best of their skills and time availability.
The communication was always easy, positive and on point. 


**Patrik** was my direct partner. We coded together the Backend part of the project using Symfony, 
as well as implemented in Symfony the code that the Frontend Team developed. He was always extremely positive and reliable, 
the communication with him was always smooth and clear. 
He  was able to produce new parts of (quality) code on a short period of time and didn't shy away from any challenges.
By being an early-bird, he created a good synergy with my night-owl schedule. Always kept me updated on his progress, even outside stand ups.
His engagement made it possible to kickstart the realisation of many features of the application, 
making it possible for the whole team to see (within a few days) a good draft of the basic fundamental functionalities of the application.
His contribution was fundamental to the good realisation of the project, he was quick and organised, 
and given the chance I would definitely work again with him.


**Felix** and **Uros** worked as  a Team in developing the Frontend side of this project. 
**Felix** was the one that drafted and proposed the overall Layout that was then chosen by the group. 
He worked fast, was always on time and communication with him was also clear, open and constructive.
I can say the same for **Uros** who also contributed at the best of his time availability, 
his positive attitude and clear communication allowed the whole team to mantain the schedule
adapting it to a more flexible timetable. Whereas **Felix**'s contribution was an effective long sprint 
that kickstarted and gave momentum to the Project and allowed the whole team to build upon his contribution. 
**Uros**'s contribution in contrast was one of a slower but constant marathon.
Their differences and skills made it possible to finish this project smoothly.


I want to thank **Patrik** and **Felix** for the dedication and positive attitude as well as the decisive impact of your work on the project.
But I also want to thank **Uros** and **Bilal** for being able to juggle between this project, family duties and work and still making your contribution valuable.
